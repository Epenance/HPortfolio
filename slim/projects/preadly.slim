          h2 New website with <span class="bold">responsive</span> layout and Search engine <span class="bold">optimized</span> content
          p I got handed over a layout in photoshop and was in charge of turning the static design into a fully useable Wordpress theme for the telemarketing company Partner Dialog.
          p The design only had a desktop version so I had to "come up" with the layout for smaller resolutions and think it turned out pretty neat.
          p My biggest challenge during this project was figuring a way for the sidebar submenu to be incorporated on mobile resolutions.
