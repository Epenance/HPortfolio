          p This was my first time working with Magento after having our Magento developer leave I had to read up and figure out how to implement the design in it.
          p It was a great joy to work with Simon from Gamestation who had many ideas that he wanted to implement and we simply worked our way through the list and ended up with a hell of a website!
